We care about worst cases.

** Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort:
These 3 do well and better when the data is small, but not when it;s big data.
Best time complexity: Bubble sort O(n) and Insertion sort O(n)
Worst time complexity: all 3 is O(n^2)
Space complexity: all 3 is O(1)

** Merge sort
